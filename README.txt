CppRed - A port of the original Pokemon Red/Blue for Gameboy to modern C++. 

Project goals:
* Produce code that's easy to study and modify.
* 100% accurate behavior is not a goal, but in some cases some effort will be
  used to preserve specific behaviors, such as the famous Mew glitch.
* Using macro switches allowing the possibility to produce specific builds with
  some of the bugs fixed.
* Maintain bidirectional compatibility with common emulator save files.
